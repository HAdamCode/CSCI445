            Here is a litte bit of information on my Ford Excursion:
        </p>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Excursion">
            The Ford Excursion is a heavy duty (Class 2), full-sized SUV that was sold by Ford from 2000 to 2005. 
            The third SUV derived from the Ford F-Series (after the Ford Bronco and the Ford Expedition), 
            the model line was the longest and heaviest SUV ever to enter mass production at the time.
