	<h2>Importance of CSS</h2>
	<p>Anyone who wants to program web pages should have some 
	understanding of <span class="a">CSS</span> Some reasons paraphrased from 
	<a href="https://bootcamp.ce.ucf.edu/blog/why-everyone-should-learn-html-css/">
	bootcamp</a>:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="a">CSS</span> is a fundamental part of the web</li>
		<li>You (or someone you know) may want to create your own site - be
			an entrepeneur!</li>
		<li>You can create <em>unique</em> websites - strut your stuff!</li>
		<li>You can make more money - are you a full-stack developer?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Another reason: it will challenge how you think about programming. 
	<span class="a">CSS</span> is NOT like other languages! Embrace it and you'll expand your
	flexibility.</p>
